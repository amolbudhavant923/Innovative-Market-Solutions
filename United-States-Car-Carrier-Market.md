Similarly, car rental agencies that manage large fleets of vehicles also depend on car carriers to move their cars between locations or to replenish their fleets. The “Others” category reflects the diversity and flexibility within the car carrier market, highlighting the varied needs of organizations and industries that require transportation of vehicles. This diversity ensures that the market remains dynamic and adaptable to different business models and consumer demands. As the demand for various vehicle types and transportation models evolves, this segment is expected to grow, fueled by ongoing advancements in logistics and car carrier technology.
